## REBUILD WILD TIGER THAI WEBSITE - http://www.wildtigerwa.net/index.html

Wild Tiger Thai is a well established restaurant and bar in the heart of Vancouver, Washington (US). The restaurant is gorgeous, but the website does not reflect the quality of the dine-in experience, or the tasty foods. Engineers, you are tasked with reconstructing this web site into a beautiful and responsive web application! Feel free to work as a group or to take on this task solo. I will explain how the winner will be selected as we near the end date, but please understand, 2 individuals have the opportunity to win big this time around. The individual who is voted by the community as the winner may win the $250 reward, but the owner of Wild Tiger Thai may grant someone else a much bigger reward and a potential purchase of your source code!
